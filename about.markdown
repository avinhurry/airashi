    Hey there! I'm Chermagne, a big food enthusiast and the creator of Kapwa Kitchen. I just wanted to say a huge thank you for checking out my website and all the things it has to offer. Let me give you a little insight into who I am and what Kapwa Kitchen stands for.
  </p>

  <p>
    To start off, I'm a British-Filipino who grew up surrounded by mouthwatering homemade dishes. Every meal was a chance to show love and care for the people around you, by sharing and enjoying delicious food together.

    As I entered the working world, I noticed how many dreaded lunchtime. Struggling to find affordable, nutritious, and tasty meals, working professionals often settled for meal deals and unhealthy snacks. Busy lifestyles meant little time for preparing lunches that are nutritionally balanced enough to keep everyone going until dinner.

  <p>
    In Filipino culture there's a strong emphasis on togetherness, known as “Kapwa” - taking care of your community and providing for everyone. I thought maybe I could lend a hand and share my love for food and passion for health, just like my family did for me and others as I was growing up.

    On top of that, I've always been a fan of anime, which introduced me to Japanese culture and expanded my culinary horizons to different cuisines. When I had the chance to visit Japan in 2023, I was captivated by the meticulous care and pride they put into presenting food, especially with bento boxes. The food was not only visually stunning but also packed with amazing flavors and nutrition. Interestingly, as I delved deeper into the culture, I discovered that Japanese culture is rooted in the concept of harmony "Wa."

    With these values at heart, I felt a strong urge to take care of those around me by blending the Filipino community culture of "Kapwa" and the Japanese concept of harmony "Wa" through food, also broadening my recipes to other cultural cuisines across the world. And that's how Kapwa Kitchen was born, along with my passion for sharing a diverse range of homemade, nutritionally balanced, and absolutely delicious recipes. My ultimate goal is to provide everyone with lunches, infused with love and care, just like the meals my family shared with me when I was younger.
